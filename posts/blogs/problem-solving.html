      <h2>How I approach a problem</h2>
      <p>
        When tackling a programming problem there are a lot of different methods I use to solving
        the problem which I will discuss, but none are more important to me personally than breaking
        the problem down into smaller, more achievable tasks.
      </p>
      <h2>Break it down</h2>
      <p>
        To make talking about solving a problem a little easier, lets identify a real-world problem
        and solve it together step-by-step.
      </p>
      <p>Let's for example, pretend we are trying to solve the problem of reversing a string.</p>
      <p>We are given this variable, and the rest is up to us.</p>
      <p><code>const string = "!ereht olleH";</code></p>
      <p>
        Ok, so first we decide whether we want this code to run immediately and be used once, or
        whether we want to make it a function so that if we ever need to reverse a string in the
        future, we have this utility available.
      </p>
      <p>Making it a function seems smarter. Let's make it a function.</p>
      <pre>
function reverseString() {

}</pre
      >
      <p>Done.</p>
      <h2>Sanity Checking</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout every step of the process I like to log the output, so we can compare the
        expected output to what is ACTUALLY being outputted.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way, if we know we have the correct output at this stage, then anything that is
        unexpected following this must be an issue with our most recent change.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is much better than writing the entire solution at once, and then trying to find where
        problems were introduced at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our function will need to accept a string to work on, lets do that next, and log out its
        contents.
      </p>
      <pre>
function reverseString(string) {
  console.log(string);

// "!ereht olleH"
}</pre
      >
      <p>Awesome, we have the correct output at this stage.</p>
      <h2>Keep it simple, stupid.</h2>
      <p>Now we need to reverse this puppy.</p>
      <p>
        There are going to be numerous ways to solve any problem, but we should always start with
        the simplest, and move on from there. See also
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" target="_blank">Occam's razor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data-types in javascript come with some built-in methods, does the String data-type come
        with a reversing function? If so, we are almost done!
      </p>
      <p>I search Google for <code>javascript reverse string</code></p>
      <p>
        Bummer, simply looking at the results from Google, I can see there are no built-in functions
        to reverse a string (This is lucky, because this would be a really short story otherwise,
        and make our function pretty tiny.)
      </p>
      <p>
        What I do see on the same search results page is:
        <code>Array.prototype.reverse()</code> on the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse"
          target="_blank"
          >Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we can cut up our string into an array and reverse it, and put it back together, that
        might work? Lets search to see if it's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I search Google for <code>javascript cut string into array</code> and also
        <code>javascript join array</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wow, awesome the first results are <code>String.prototype.split()</code> on
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split"
          target="_blank"
          >MDN</a
        >, and <code>String.prototype.join()</code> on
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join"
          target="_blank"
          >MDN</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Try things</h2>
      <p>One thing at a time.</p>
      <p>
        Lets chop up our string into an array of characters, and again, do a sanity check by logging
        it out.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see from the documentation that the <code>.split()</code> method takes a string argument
        of where we would like to split the string. If we wanted to split by spaces we could pass in
        a space <code>' '</code>, but in this example we need every character to have its own
        position in the array, spaces included. So to split it by every character, our argument will
        be an empty string <code>''</code>.
      </p>
      <pre>
function reverseString(string) {
  const charsSplit = string.split('')
  console.log(charsSplit);

// ['!','e','r','e','h','t',' ',
// 'o','l','l','e','H']
}</pre
      >
      <p>
        Sweeeeeeeet! Our sanity checking log tells us it worked, so we are on the right track up to
        this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we can tackle the reversing! Lets read about and apply that
        <code>.reverse()</code> method we read about in the documentation, and see what happens.
        According to the documentation, we do not need to supply an argument to this method.
      </p>
      <pre>
function reverseString(string) {
  const charsSplit = string.split('')
  const charsReversed = charsSplit.reverse();
  console.log(charsReversed);

// ['H','e','l','l','o',' ',
// 't','h','e','r','e','!']
}</pre
      >
      <p>Ho boy, that works! And from the log we can make out the words.</p>
      <p>
        We are almost done now. We just need to join the array back together with the
        <code>.join()</code> method we found, and return the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        We see from the documentation, that just like the <code>.split()</code> method, we can
        provide it a string to separate each item of the array when joining it back together. In
        this case we just want it back the way it was with no alterations, so we pass it another
        empty string <code>''</code>.
      </p>
      <p>Lets try that now.</p>
      <pre>
function reverseString(string) {
  const charsSplit = string.split('')
  const charsReversed = charsSplit.reverse();
  const charsJoined = charsReversed.join('');
  console.log(charsJoined);
        
// Hello there!
}</pre
      >
      <p>
        It works! now the only thing left to do to make this function ..err functional, is to return
        the value instead of logging it to the console!
      </p>
      <pre>
function reverseString(string) {
  const charsSplit = string.split('')
  const charsReversed = charsSplit.reverse();
  const charsJoined = charsReversed.join('');
  return charsJoined;
}</pre
      >
      <p>..Aaaaaaaannd done!</p>
      <p>
        We now have a <code>reverseString()</code> function we can reuse any time we need to reverse
        a string!
      </p>
      <h2>Other problem solving methods</h2>
      <p>If you are ever stuck on a problem, there are other useful methods to help you.</p>
      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        Write out the steps of the problem in plain english to give you an idea of where to start,
        and a list of action items to achieve on your way to solving the bigger problem.
      </p>
      <h3>The rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>
        Explain the problem to yourself, or somebody else. As you talk through the problem you force
        yourself to step through it, and possibly explain it in a simpler way that might trigger a
        solution or next step for yourself.
      </p>
      <h3>Ask for help</h3>
      <p>There is no shame in asking for help.</p>
      <p>
        I like to remember that everything we know is the result of being taught by somebody or
        something.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is often so much more productive to ask somebody for help rather than working on the same
        problem for hours without progressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your time could be better spent working on something else, without trying to reinvent the
        wheel.
