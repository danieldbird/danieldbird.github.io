          <h4>How I approach a problem</h4>
          <p>
            When tackling a programming problem there are a lot of different methods I use to
            solving the problem which I will discuss, but none are more important to me personally
            that breaking the problem down into smaller, more achievable tasks.
          </p>
          <h4>Break it down</h4>
          <p>
            To make talking about solving a problem a little easier, lets identify a real-world
            problem and solve it together step-by-step.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's for example, pretend we are trying to solve the problem of reversing a string.
          </p>
          <p>We are given this variable, and the rest is up to us.</p>
          <p><code>const string = "!ereht olleH";</code></p>
          <p>
            Ok, so first we decide whether we want this code to be run immediately and used once, or
            whether we want to make it a function so that if we ever need to reverse a string in the
            future, we have this utility available.
          </p>
          <p>Let's make it a function.</p>
          <pre><code>function reverseString() {
 
}</code></pre>
          <p>Done.</p>
          <h4>Sanity Checking</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout every step of the process, I like to log the output, so we can compare the
            expected output, to what is ACTUALLY being output.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, if we know we have the correct output at this stage, then anything that is
            unexpected must be an issue with the most recent change.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is much better than writing the entire solution at once, and then trying to find
            where the issue is at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            It will need to accept a string to work on, lets do that next, and log out its contents.
          </p>
          <pre><code>function reverseString(string) {
    console.log(string);

// "!ereht olleH"
}</code></pre>
          <p>Awesome, we have the correct output at this stage.</p>
          <h4>Keep it simple, stupid.</h4>
          <p>Now we need to reverse this puppy.</p>
          <p>
            There are likely numerous ways to solve this problem, but we should always start with
            the simplest, and move on from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data-types in javascript come with some built-in methods, does the String data-type
            come with a reversing function?
          </p>
          <p>I search Google for <code>javascript reverse string</code></p>
          <p>
            Bummer, simply looking at the results from Google, I can see there are no built-in
            functions to reverse a string. (Lucky, because this would be a really short story
            otherwise, and make our function unnecessary.)
          </p>
          <p>
            What I do see on the same search results page is:
            <code>Array.prototype.reverse()</code> on the
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse"
              >Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we can cut up our string into an array and reverse it, and put it back together, that
            might work? Lets search to see if it's possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I search Google for <code>javascript cut string into array</code> and also
            <code>javascript join array</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wow, awesome the first results are <code>String.prototype.split()</code> on
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split"
              >MDN</a
            >, and <code>String.prototype.join()</code> on
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join"
              >MDN</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h4>Try things</h4>
          <p>One thing at a time.</p>
          <p>
            Lets chop up our string into an array of characters, and again, do a sanity check by
            logging it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            We see from the documentation that the <code>.split()</code> method takes a string
            argument of where we would like to split the string. If we wanted to split by spaces we
            could pass in a space <code>' '</code>, but in this example we need every character to
            have its own position in the array, spaces included. So our argument will be an empty
            string <code>''</code>.
          </p>
          <pre><code>function reverseString(string) {
    const charactersSplit = string.split('')
    console.log(charactersSplit);

// ['!','e','r','e','h','t',' ',
// 'o','l','l','e','H']
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Sweeeeeeeet! Our sanity checking log tells us it worked and we are on the right track up
            to this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we can tackle the reversing! Lets apply that <code>.reverse()</code> method we read
            about in the documentation, and see what happens.
          </p>
          <pre><code>function reverseString(string) {
    const charactersSplit = string.split('')
    const charactersReversed = charactersSplit.reverse();
    console.log(charactersReversed);

// ['H','e','l','l','o',' ',
// 't','h','e','r','e','!']
}</code></pre>
          <p>Ho boy, that works! And from the log we can make out the words.</p>
          <p>
            We are almost done now. We just need to join the array back together and return the
            output.
          </p>
          <p>
            We see from the documentation, that just like the <code>.split()</code> method, we can
            provide it a string to separate each item of the array when joining it back together. In
            this case we just want it back the way it was with no alterations, so we pass it another
            empty string <code>''</code>.
          </p>
          <p>Lets try that now.</p>
          <pre><code>function reverseString(string) {
    const charactersSplit = string.split('')
    const charactersReversed = charactersSplit.reverse();
    const charactersJoined = charactersReversed.join('');
    console.log(charactersJoined);
        
// Hello there!
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            It works! now the only thing left to do to make this function, er, functional, is to
            return the value instead of logging it to the console!
          </p>
          <pre><code>function reverseString(string) {
  const charactersSplit = string.split('')
  const charactersReversed = charactersSplit.reverse();
  const charactersJoined = charactersReversed.join('');
  return charactersJoined;
}</code></pre>
          <p>..Aaaaaaaannd done!</p>
          <h4>Other problem solving methods</h4>
          <p>If you are ever stuck on a problem there are other useful methods to help you.</p>
          <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
          <p>
            Write out the steps of the problem in plain english to give you an idea of where to
            start, and a progression through the problem.
          </p>
          <h5>The rubber ducky method</h5>
          <p>
            Explain the problem to yourself, or somebody else. As you talk through the problem you
            force yourself to step through it, and possibly explain it in a simpler way that might
            trigger a solution for yourself.
          </p>
          <h5>Ask for help</h5>
          <p>There is no shame in asking for help.</p>
          <p>
            I like to remember that everything we know is the result of being taught by somebody or
            something.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is often so much more productive to ask somebody for help rather than working on the
            same problem for hours without progressing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your time could be better spent working on something else, without trying to reinvent
            the wheel.
