          <p>Hi there, my name is Daniel Bird.</p>
          <p>I was born in Ipswich, Queensland.</p>
          <p>
            I grew up in Melbourne, Victoria and travelled to and from a small outback town called
            Coober Pedy, in South Australia every school holidays to visit my mother and two
            sisters.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been living in Auckland for approximately 10 years now with my wife and daughter.
            It‚Äôs a great place to be, it feels laid back, and has an island vibe to me. I have never
            really given a lot of thought to values and identity, but I will give it a go.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess I could say I‚Äôve always struggled with a sense of personal identity. As a young
            child my mother and father divorced and I travelled around a lot. I have never felt like
            I truly belonged anywhere really. Everyone else seemed to have a strong sense of
            personal identity and / or national identity. Which I struggled with as a child, but
            have come to accept and see as somewhat of a positive.
          </p>
          <p>
            I realised early on that the location I was born, to what parents I was born, my gender,
            my sexual preferences, the amount of melanin in my skin, was all chance, non of my
            doing, and the same for everyone else. Having that mindset, it has just never made
            logical sense to dislike somebody based on these characteristics. This has definitely
            shaped my personal values. That everybody is equal, and we all deserve the same
            opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luck, in my opinion should never factor in to available opportunities, or the way
            somebody is treated. Being a dick, yes, luck, no.
          </p>
          <p>
            My values were shaped heavily by my father, he was a mensch, and I miss him. I learnt
            the value of being eclectic in life. Not shutting yourself off to experiences, and
            taking the best from everything you come across. A little Buddhism here, a touch of
            Martin Luther King Jr there, something you read in a book here etc.. not to get trapped
            in, and forced to accept the dogma of one thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            My mother is extremely charitable to a fault, so I learned kindness and deep empathetic
            connection from her.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have struggled with anxiety in the past which has held me back a lot. There has always
            been a voice in the back of my head reminding me of the worst possible outcome of every
            situation which isn‚Äôt a great confidence booster. I have managed to accept and embrace
            it as I got older though. It has been a useful tool for planning, and preparedness. I
            have built a successful business here in Auckland, so I know as much as I think it is a
            negative, it is operable.
          </p>
          <p>Oh lordy, this is getting long.. Wrap it up Daniel.</p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm attending this Dev Academy because I have learnt a lot in development over the
            years, but have never had any formal training, and felt like there were gaps in my
            knowledge. I want to be the best version of myself, for myself, and for my family. I
            know I can do more, be more, and challenge myself more in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            My dream would be to meet like-minded individuals that have the same passion and drive
            to build things and businesses as me. Somebody who is better in front of an audience
            than I.
          </p>
          <p>
            To work hard and build something together. If it doesn‚Äôt work, figure out why, iterate,
            and try new projects until we have something.
          </p>
          <p>Anyway, that‚Äôs me. Apologies for the novella.</p>
          <p>I look forward to meeting you all and wish everyone the very best! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
