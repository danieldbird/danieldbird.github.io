      <p>Hi there, my name is Daniel Bird.</p>
      <p>I was born in Ipswich, Queensland.</p>
      <p>
        I grew up in Melbourne, Victoria and travelled to and from a small outback town called
        Coober Pedy, in South Australia every school holidays to visit my mother and two sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been living in Auckland for approximately 10 years now with my wife and daughter.
        It's a great place to be, it feels laid back, and has an island vibe to me. I have never
        really given a lot of thought to values and identity, but I will give it a go.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess I could say I've always struggled with a sense of personal identity. As a young
        child my mother and father divorced and I travelled around a lot. I have never felt like I
        truly belonged anywhere really. Everyone else seemed to have a strong sense of personal
        identity and / or national identity. Which I struggled with as a child, but have come to
        accept and see as somewhat of a positive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realised early on that the location I was born, to what parents I was born, my gender, my
        sexual preferences, the amount of melanin in my skin, was all chance, non of my doing, and
        the same for everyone else. Having that mindset, it has just never made logical sense to
        dislike somebody based on these characteristics. This has definitely shaped my personal
        values. That everybody is equal, and we all deserve the same opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luck, in my opinion should never factor in to available opportunities, or the way somebody
        is treated. Being a dick, yes, luck, no.
      </p>
      <p>
        My values were shaped heavily by my father, he was a mensch, and I miss him. I learnt the
        value of being eclectic in life. Not shutting yourself off to experiences, and taking the
        best from everything you come across. A little Buddhism here, a touch of Martin Luther King
        Jr there, something you read in a book here etc.. not to get trapped in, and forced to
        accept the dogma of one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mother is extremely charitable to a fault, so I learned kindness and deep empathetic
        connection from her.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have struggled with anxiety in the past which has held me back a lot. There has always
        been a voice in the back of my head reminding me of the worst possible outcome of every
        situation which isn't a great confidence booster. I have managed to accept and embrace it as
        I got older though. It has been a useful tool for planning, and preparedness. I have built a
        successful business here in Auckland, so I know as much as I think it is a negative, it is
        operable.
      </p>
      <p>Oh lordy, this is getting long.. Wrap it up Daniel.</p>
      <p>
        I'm attending this Dev Academy because I have learnt a lot in development over the years,
        but have never had any formal training, and felt like there were gaps in my knowledge. I
        want to be the best version of myself, for myself, and for my family. I know I can do more,
        be more, and challenge myself more in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dream would be to meet like-minded individuals that have the same passion and drive to
        build things and businesses as me. Somebody who is better in front of an audience than I.
      </p>
      <p>
        To work hard and build something together. If it doesn't work, figure out why, iterate, and
        try new projects until we have something.
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, that's me. Apologies for the novella.</p>
      <p>I look forward to meeting you all and wish everyone the very best! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
