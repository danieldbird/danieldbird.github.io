      <h2>Surprise, surprise</h2>
      <p>
        What surprised me most about learning core is that it is at all important. It's nice to know
        that a persons feelings are important in this day and age. I have in the past never had any
        career counselling, or guidance. I have just always assumed your mental health is your own
        problem, and not the concern of your peers, colleagues, or employer. It is nice and
        comforting to know this.
      </p>
      <p>
        It does make sense, that you want your employees to be happy, and not only for selfless
        reasons. But you want your workers to be the most productive, and if their mind is not on
        the job because they are struggling with an issue mentally, or are burnt out, they are not
        going to produce quality work. Also they are more likely not to be great team members in a
        company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have learnt that I can have a conversation with people I don't know and that it is not as
        bad as I thought it would be. I am able to identify my ego, and attempt to keep it in check,
        and celebrate everyone else's achievements, and support others. I need to make sure that
        while I am being supportive and helpful to others, that I maintain a healthy focus on my own
        mental health, and my own time, to make sure the pressure of my own deadlines doesn't get
        overwhelming.
      </p>
      <h2>Meditating on meditation</h2>
      <p>
        I should really take time to meditate, I just never feel like doing it. I feel ok after it's
        done, maybe even good, but the though of sitting down and doing it I postpone and postpone,
        and end up seeing it like a chore.
      </p>
      <h2>The value of core</h2>
      <p>
        The role of values, empathy and self awareness is critically important when working with
        other people. To be kind, and generous, and to see things from another persons perspective.
        After all that is what I would want from others.
      </p>
      <h2>My challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging parts of core are taking the time. Taking the time to journal, reflect,
        meditate etc. It's challenging to see it as productive work. That at any one time it is the
        most important thing I could be doing. It's hard for me. But I need to work on it. It was
        also really challenging in the beginning to talk to people unsolicited. To make a cold call
        and chat about something. I find it hard to talk when I have nothing much to say, and I find
        it really pressurising to be given a topic and be told to talk about it for a specific
        period of time. I very rarely, in any other part of my life talk for more than 10 seconds
        continuously without another person talking back to me.
      </p>
      <h2>Why focus on core?</h2>
      <p>
        The reason for the focus on core is to produce people who are able to work and collaborate
        with others in a kind and productive way. It is likely one of the areas most programmers or
        introverts struggle with the most. Communicating and putting yourself out there. It's no
        good knowing everything if you cant communicate it, and therefore put it into practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't feel like a waste of time for me, but it can be the most laborious part for me.
        When I see the Tech sections I get excited, when I see the core sections I feel much less
        excited. I guess because things you don't know or are not good at are hard, that is why we
        must practice them. But sometimes hard things are not as enjoyable.
