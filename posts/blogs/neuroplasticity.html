      <h2>Neuroplasticity principles and benefits</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity encourages people and removes any false
        blocks as to why they are not the kind of person who can achieve something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internalising that the brain is malleable, and can be worked on like a muscle in the body to
        perform better and better over time with training.
      </p>
      <p>
        That a persons ability at birth is not what they are stuck with for the rest of their life.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also provides them with tools to continuously improve their neuroplasticity going
        forward.
      </p>
      <h2>How to implement these principles</h2>
      <p>
        It is motivating to know that intelligence isn't a fixed trait, and with the right mindset,
        I can continually improve and grow in every aspect of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        That small incremental improvements over time can make huge differences in the long term. So
        it would be greatly beneficial if I can internalise this mindset, and make it a daily
        practice to learn something new.
      </p>
      <h2>Ways to increase neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        Ways to increase Neuroplasticity is to remind yourself how the brain works and not think
        that potential or ability is fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This comes through practice. Practice of thinking, and practice of the actions that unlock
        this Neuroplasticity in yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way is to put information in context, and think of analogies for whatever it is you
        have just learnt. This can help conceptualise what is being learned and how it fits in to
        other things, which joins the dots in the brain.
      </p>
      <h2>Further thinking</h2>
      <p>Plato is quoted as saying,</p>
      <blockquote>"knowledge is remembering".</blockquote>
      <p>So to improve your memory of something, practice it.</p>
      <p>Here is a video I found usefulexplaining what neuroplasticity is, and it's history.</p>
