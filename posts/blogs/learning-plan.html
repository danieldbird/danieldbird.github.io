      <h2>Long term goal or career pathway</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to either start a company that provides a software as a service
        product. Or to work as a developer in as part of a larger company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to use the skills I learn to understand the complete development stack from
        beginning to end, and apply these in any project or company I am part of in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am hoping my networking skills are greatly improved, and there may be an opportunity to
        find a business partner among my peers at dev academy, or network in finding a job that
        suits my skill level.
      </p>
      <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
      <p>
        My strengths are that when I am invested, and truly understand an objective, I am very good
        at getting there with brainstorming and persistence.
      </p>
      <p>
        I absolutely love collaborating with others who share the same passions and who can agree on
        a concrete direction that we both strive toward.
      </p>
      <p>I am at my strongest and most productive when I have a plan and goal for the day.</p>
      <p>
        I am compassionate and empathetic by nature, and this is a great asset. However, I have to
        remember that my own mental health and development is really important. So I need to make
        sure that I am sufficiently prepared and ahead, before helping others.
      </p>
      <p>
        My limitations are understanding complex logic without first having worked it out myself. If
        I am presented with code or logic somebody else has written I can struggle to understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also struggle with public speaking and being put on the spot to answer a question before I
        can think of an answer. I will be working hard on that during bootcamp.
      </p>
      <h2>Non-technical challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Some of my biggest non-technical challenges will be public speaking. Getting over the fear
        of not knowing the answer to a question when being asked in a group setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another challenge will be maintaining consistency. Sticking to the plan and schedule I have
        set for myself. When it's time to do something I thought was a good enough idea to put in my
        calendar, do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work on not being so self-judgemental and celebrating successes that I have. Remembering the
        principle that the brain is malleable, and not fixed, and I can improve what I currently
        struggle with.
      </p>

      <h2>What would I like to develop</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to improve my confidence with public speaking. To be comfortable not knowing
        something, and be able to be asked something I may not know, and be able to respond without
        feeling embarrassed. Not then focusing on that embarrassment, and not being present for any
        other questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would love to develop my consistency and routine. At the moment my routine is mostly
        guided by inertia and whatever I think to do next, and not decisive planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to work on improving my mental health, and the way I speak to myself
        internally. Being more accepting of myself, and less critical.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also need to work on taking criticism positively instead of personally, and learn to use
        it to improve myself.
      </p>
      <h2>Expectations of the Bootcamp team</h2>
      <p>
        My expectations of the bootcamp team is just to be there. To be supportive if I need
        assistance, and to encourage me. To help me get the best out of myself and see the positives
        in myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to have clear instruction as to what the challenges and goals to be achieved
        are broadly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd also like feedback about my progress. What I have done well and what I should work to
        improve.
      </p>

      <h2>Expectations of myself</h2>
      <p>
        If I am stuck on a problem for a period of time without progress, I will seek help from my
        peers, and if I can't get clarification I will seek further coaching and instruction from
        facilitators.
      </p>
      <p>
        My commitment in managing my workload during bootcamp will be to schedule everything with
        time blocks, and stick to that schedule.
      </p>
      <p>To have a clear direction and goal for the day is key for me in being productive.</p>
      <p>
        I will request and accept feedback in a positive way, and be able to provide others feedback
        in a way that doesn't cause tension.
