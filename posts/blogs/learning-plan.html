      <h2>Long term Goal</h2>
      <p>My career pathway would be to get a job as a junior or entry level developer.</p>
      <p>
        Then to get advance my learning and competency to get a job as an intermediate or senior
        developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If in time, I decide to build something alone or with somebody else, I will pursue that.
      </p>
      <h2>Learning strengths and limitations</h2>
      <p>
        My strengths are when I am interested in something, I want to learn as much as I can about
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am open to discussion and learning from others. I love collaborating with people and
        planning together.
      </p>
      <p>When I have a plan for the day, or a goal, I find it easier to work.</p>
      <p>
        My limitations in learning are feeling as though I am behind, rushing and wanting to jump
        ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also struggled with public speaking and being put on the spot. I feel as though I am
        much better at carefully considered thought before speaking about something.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I don't have a plan for the day, I can get distracted reading, researching, or helping
        others.
      </p>
      <h2>What non-tech skills would I like to develop</h2>
      <p>I would LOVE to improve my interview skills.</p>
      <p>
        Even the word interview gives me shivers. Being asked questions on the spot and being
        worried I don't know the answer, or will clam up and go blank. A huge fear of mine. So being
        exposed to that, and gaining some confidence in that aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being less comparative and judgemental of myself in relation to others, and not feeling as
        competitive.
      </p>
      <h2>How I will manage the workload</h2>
      <p>
        Having a plan for each day / time-block is really key for me. Setting time blocks with
        regular break intervals so as not to get burnt out, lose focus, or stuck on a problem for
        more time than I should.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should request and accept feedback and be able to provide others feedback in a way that
        doesn't cause tension.
      </p>
      <h2>My strategy for dealing with problems</h2>
      <p>Take a break and come back to the problem with fresh eyes.</p>
      <p>Work on breaking down whatever is getting to me into smaller, more manageable pieces.</p>
      <p>Reach out for help and guidance from a colleague, facilitator or manager.</p>
      <h2>My commitment for seeking help</h2>
      <p>
        I will reach out to my colleagues first, and if I am really stuck ask questions to my
        facilitator or manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should probably do this if I am stuck for a complete pomodoro time block of 30 mins. Any
        longer than this, and my time could be better spent solving another problem, or breaking the
        current problem into smaller more achievable chunks.
      </p>
      <h2>What I expect from facilitators</h2>
      <p>A supportive, inclusive environment.</p>
      <p>
        Clear instruction as to what the outcomes for the day are, or the single problem itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feedback about my progress, what I have done well, and what I should focus on to get better,
        and be able to identify that for me individually.
      </p>
      <h2>My personal scheduling</h2>
      <p>
        There are no times during this course where I committed to anything other than Dev Academy.
      </p>
      <p>I will be available during the office hours and occasionally afterwards.</p>
      <p>
        I may have the odd appointment for myself, which I will inform my facilitator of when I have
        a date.
