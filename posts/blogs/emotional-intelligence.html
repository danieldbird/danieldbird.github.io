          <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence, sometimes referred to as EQ, or EI, is a persons ability to
            observe their own emotions, and control them with attention and mindfulness.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also includes a persons ability to understand and interpret somebody else‚Äôs emotions,
            and respond to them in a thoughtful way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a practice of strengthening your emotional intelligence, it is easy to get
            caught in detrimental thought patterns, being self critical, and perceiving others in a
            way that is fundamentally untrue.
          </p>

          <h4>How is it different from IQ?</h4>
          <p>
            IQ is a measurement usually established through testing your ability to solve problems.
          </p>
          <p>These problems are all academic, and not at all emotional.</p>
          <p>
            A persons ability to solve academic problems, has no bearing on how they deal with their
            internal critical thinking, or how they empathise with other people.
          </p>

          <h4>Why is it important?</h4>
          <p>
            Learning about emotional intelligence is important because nearly everything we do in
            life requires interaction with other humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if you are a developer and want to only code all day, you will need to be selling
            whatever you are making, or talking with a manager, a client, a colleague etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are unable to work as a part of a cohesive group, more often than not people
            would rather not work with you no matter how good at problem solving you are.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would rather work with somebody I can get along with and have fun solving problems
            together, than to be working with somebody that is unapproachable, and does not
            communicate in a constructive and positive way.
