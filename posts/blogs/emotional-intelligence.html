      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence, sometimes referred to as EQ, or EI, is a persons ability to observe
        their own emotions, and control them with attention and mindfulness.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also includes a persons ability to understand and interpret somebody else‚Äôs emotions, and
        respond to them in a thoughtful way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a practice of strengthening your emotional intelligence, it is easy to get caught in
        detrimental thought patterns, being self critical, and perceiving others in a way that is
        fundamentally untrue.
      </p>

      <h2>How is it different from IQ?</h2>
      <p>IQ is a measurement usually established through testing your ability to solve problems.</p>
      <p>These problems are all academic, and not at all emotional.</p>
      <p>
        A persons ability to solve academic problems, has no bearing on how they deal with their
        internal critical thinking, or how they empathise with other people.
      </p>

      <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
      <p>
        Learning about emotional intelligence is important because nearly everything we do in life
        requires interaction with other humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you are a developer and want to only code all day, you will need to be selling
        whatever you are making, or talking with a manager, a client, a colleague etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are unable to work as a part of a cohesive group, more often than not people would
        rather not work with you no matter how good at problem solving you are.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would rather work with somebody I can get along with and have fun solving problems
        together, than to be working with somebody that is unapproachable, and does not communicate
        in a constructive and positive way.
