      <h2>The difference between HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>
        The differences between HTML and CSS could be understood using an analogy to how a house is
        built.
      </p>
      <p>
        You first draw out the plans of a house. This is what is known as wireframing in web design,
        and can be done on paper, or on computer, and is the roughing out of what the end product
        will look like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then comes the framing of the house, dividing the house perimeter into what will later
        become separate rooms. This is like marking up the HTML. Creating the space for what will
        later become the header, footer, sidebar etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have the structure of the house, then you are able to do the finishing work, like
        putting in and selecting variable items like insulation, gib board, mouldings, paint
        colours, carpet and its colour etc. This is like the CSS of a website, and how it styles the
        basic HTML structure with varying styles.
      </p>
      <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
      <p>Control flow can be described using anything that requires a decision.</p>
      <p>Let's use the analogy of traffic on the roads.</p>
      <p>
        A human can perform an almost infinite amount of manoeuvres, however in this example we will
        pretend we are following the road rules. So there you are at a traffic light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using pseudo code we can describe process flow like. Is the light green? Yes, go. No, wait.
        And repeat this question over and over until we eventually get a Yes answer (or honked from
        behind), and begin moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        At every point we never leave the process flow, even while driving in a straight line. The
        process is; what is the speed limit, are we going below that speed? Yes, increase speed, no
        decrease speed. Approaching a traffic light, is it green? Yes, proceed. No, slow to a stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then because we know this process, we can loop back this process flow to our waiting at the
        traffic light function. We now have a very basic driving between traffic lights while
        following the speed limit process flow.
      </p>
      <h2>The DOM</h2>
      <p>
        The document object model (DOM) is the hierarchical, tree-like structure of a webpage
        represented as data. The purpose of this data representation is so it can then be modified
        to change the document structure, style, or content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like a javascript object, its elements can be selected using Javascript, and then
        manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, elements in the DOM can be selected using the elements tag, id, class,
        attribute etc. Once selected, you can apply modifications to it.
        <code>document.body.style.background = "red";</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        This selects the document, and the body element inside the document, and changes its
        background colour to red.
      </p>
      <h2>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
      <p>Accessing data from array and objects are similar but with distinct differences.</p>
      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>
        To access an arrays data, you type the array followed by the index number of the array value
        you want to access.
      </p>
      <code>myArr[myIndex]</code>
      <p>Remembering that arrays begin with an index of zero (0).</p>
      <p>You can return the index of an item in an array with <code>arr.indexOf('value');</code></p>
      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>
        To access a value in an object you type the object followed by either bracket or dot
        notation.
      </p>
      <code>myObj['myKey']</code>
      <br />
      <code>myObj.myKey</code>
      <p>
        Bracket notation is useful for when you are getting the key name from a variable value, in
        which case dot notation wont work.
      </p>
      <h3>Functions and why they are useful</h3>
      <p>Functions are like blocks of code that you can group together to be reusable.</p>
      <p>
        On top of that, they can be given parameters and arguments so they can work on unique data
        each time.
      </p>
      <p>This is extremely useful for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p>
        First is to be able to organise your code better and group areas of concern. If all code was
        just jumbled together like spaghetti it would be extremely difficult to refactor or fix,
        without knowing you wont break something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason is to scope your variables in a block. This is similar to the above, but it
        ensures you don't pollute the global namespace and have variables accidentally change their
        values without you meaning for them to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another great reason to use functions is so you do not repeat code. Also known as DRY (don't
        repeat yourself). If you repeat code you are not only writing more code, your files sizes
        are bigger, and if you need to change something you will end up needing to replace the same
        code in multiple places which increases the chance of introducing bugs.
