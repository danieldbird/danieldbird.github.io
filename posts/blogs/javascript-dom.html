          <h4>The difference between HTML and CSS</h4>
          <p>
            The differences between HTML and CSS could be understood using an analogy to how a house
            is built.
          </p>
          <p>
            You first draw out the plans of a house. This is what is known as wireframing in web
            design, and can be done on paper, or on computer, and is the roughing out of what the
            end product will look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then comes the framing of the house, dividing the house perimeter into what will later
            become separate rooms. This is like marking up the HTML. Creating the space for what
            will later become the header, footer, sidebar etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have the structure of the house, then you are able to do the finishing work,
            like putting in and selecting variable items like insulation, gib board, mouldings,
            paint colours, carpet and its colour etc. This is like the CSS of a website, and how it
            styles the basic HTML structure with varying styles.
          </p>
          <h4>Control flow and loops</h4>
          <p>Control flow can be described using anything that requires a decision.</p>
          <p>Let's use the analogy of traffic on the roads.</p>
          <p>
            A human can perform an almost infinite amount of manoeuvres, however in this example we
            will pretend we are following the road rules. So there you are at a traffic light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using pseudo code we can describe process flow like. Is the light green? Yes, go. No,
            wait. And repeat this question over and over until we eventually get a Yes answer (or
            honked from behind), and begin moving.
          </p>
          <p>
            At every point we never leave the process flow, even while driving in a straight line.
            The process is; what is the speed limit, are we going below that speed? Yes, increase
            speed, no decrease speed. Approaching a traffic light, is it green? Yes, proceed. No,
            slow to a stop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then because we know this process, we can loop back this process flow to our waiting at
            the traffic light function. We now have a very basic driving between traffic lights
            while following the speed limit process flow.
          </p>
          <h4>The DOM</h4>
          <p>
            The document object model (DOM) is the hierarchical, tree-like structure of a webpage
            represented as data. The purpose of this data representation is so it can then be
            modified to change the document structure, style, or content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like a javascript object, its elements can be selected using Javascript, and then
            manipulated.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, elements in the DOM can be selected using the elements tag, id, class,
            attribute etc. Once selected, you can apply modifications to it.
            <code>document.body.style.background = "red";</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            This selects the document, and the body element inside the document, and changes its
            background colour to red.
          </p>
          <h4>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h4>
          <p>Accessing data from array and objects are similar but with distinct differences.</p>
          <h5>Arrays</h5>
          <p>
            To access an arrays data, you type the array followed by the index number of the array
            value you want to access.
          </p>
          <code>myArr[myIndex]</code>
          <p>Remembering that arrays begin with an index of zero (0).</p>
          <p>
            You can return the index of an item in an array with <code>arr.indexOf('value');</code>
          </p>
          <h5>Objects</h5>
          <p>
            To access a value in an object you type the object followed by either bracket or dot
            notation.
          </p>
          <code>myObj['myKey']</code>
          <br />
          <code>myObj.myKey</code>
          <p>
            Bracket notation is useful for when you are getting the key name from a variable value,
            in which case dot notation wont work.
          </p>
          <h4>Functions and why they are useful</h4>
          <p>Functions are like blocks of code that you can group together to be reusable.</p>
          <p>
            On top of that, they can be given parameters and arguments so they can work on unique
            data each time.
          </p>
          <p>This is extremely useful for a number of reasons.</p>
          <p>
            First is to be able to organise your code better and group areas of concern. If all code
            was just jumbled together like spaghetti it would be extremely difficult to refactor or
            fix, without knowing you wont break something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another reason is to scope your variables in a block. This is similar to the above, but
            it ensures you don't pollute the global namespace and have variables accidentally change
            their values without you meaning for them to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another great reason is to use functions is so you do not repeat code. Also known as DRY
            (do not repeat yourself). If you repeat code you are not only writing more code, your
            files sizes are bigger, and if you need to change something you will end up needing to
            replace the same code in multiple places which increases the chance of introducing bugs.
