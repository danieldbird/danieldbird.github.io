      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <p>
        As part of our coursework for
        <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/" target="_blank">Enspiral Dev Academy</a>, one of our
        stretch material challenges was to participate in pair-programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dev-academy team-mate
        <a href="https://chen-yao89.github.io/" target="_blank">Chen Yao</a> had said previously
        that she would be keep to partner up for this challenge, so we went ahead and tackled this
        project together.
      </p>
      <p>The brief was to make a functioning calculator.</p>
      <p>
        We took this a step further and made it so the calculator could perform mutiple sums at
        once, and in order of operations.
      </p>
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>
        To work seamlessly together we looked at what could be the best way to collaborate on the
        project in real-time. This had to be done online.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first we tried
        <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repl.it</a>, but found
        it slow to work in.
      </p>
      <p>
        We then looked at a
        <a
          href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >VSCode extension called Live Share</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we could not get the voice audio to work through this extension, the ability to see
        each others cursor in real-time, AND be in the editor we use day-to-day with our favourite
        VSCode extensions and shortcuts, made this our method of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome the lack of voice, we utilised
        <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> calls, as
        that is where we were communicating via chat anyway.
